# Cyber-Moksha: Ethics Over Fate

A high-fidelity, narrative-driven moral dilemma RPG that reimagines the ancient game of *Snakes & Ladders* through the lens of cyber-mythology and AI-powered ethical storytelling. The goal is to reach "Moksha" (Tile 100 or 110) by navigating life's choices based on the core values of **Respect**, **Honesty**, and **Service**.

## 🌟 Core Features

### 1. Narrative-Driven Gameplay
Instead of rolling dice, players progress by choosing their path through generated moral dilemmas. Every turn presents a unique scenario that tests the player's integrity.

### 2. Real-Time AI Moral Evaluation
Using the **Gemini 3 Flash** model, every user response is analyzed for its ethical weight. The AI provides:
- **Karmic Score**: Adjusts your total Karma.
- **Board Movement**: Virtuous choices propel you forward (Ladders), while selfish acts may pull you back (Snakes).
- **Soul Analytics**: Tracks your Pragmatism, Empathy, and Chaos.

### 3. Bhagavad Gita Correlation
After every choice, the system correlates the player's action with a specific verse from the **Bhagavad Gita**.
- **Gita Cards**: Displays the verse text and English citation.
- **AI-Generated Art**: Displays a hyper-realistic, cinematic scene generated by AI that visualizes the essence of the verse.

### 4. Energy (Stamina) Management
Success in the path of virtue requires "effort."
- **Virtuous Choices**: Consumes more energy as moral discipline is challenging.
- **Selfish Choices**: Temporarily preserves or slightly restores energy, but damages long-term Karma.
- **Low Energy**: Prevents further progression, forcing players to reflect on their journey.

### 5. Lifetime Summary & Profile Analytics
Review your journey's impact through the **Summary** dashboard.
- **Kindest Act**: Identifies the decision that yielded your highest positive Karma.
- **Biggest Mistake**: Highlights the turning point that cost you the most Karma.
- **Persistent Progress**: Tracks your entire playthrough history to provide a reflective look at your moral character.

### 6. Soul Archetypes & Analytics
At the end of the journey, players receive a "Soul Signature" radar chart and a final Archetype (e.g., *The Wise Guardian*, *The Compassionate Guide*) based on their cumulative choices.

### 7. Dynamic Grid Expansion
The path to enlightenment is not always linear. Reaching specific tiles may reveal a "New Path," expanding the board and shifting the final goal.

### 8. Cyber-Mythology UI
A high-fidelity "Cyber-Moksha" aesthetic featuring:
- Glitch effects for low-karma states.
- Neon-lit game board.
- Live "Cluster" activity simulation showing other seekers.
